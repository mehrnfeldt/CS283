4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

I would like to learn more about operatings systems and how this new knowledge would make me a better programmer.  

5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

I think I am concerned with the layout and systems used in this class. I never really used GitHub for class assignments and using both Tux and GitHub for assignments concerns me slightly. I believe I am not quite fully confident with how to submit assignments yet.
